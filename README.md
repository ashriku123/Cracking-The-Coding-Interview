An attempt to solve each and every question of Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

####Arrays

1.1. [Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.1%20OneDotOne)

1.2. [Implement a function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.2%20OneDotTwo)

1.3. [Given two string, write a method to decide if one id the permutation of the other.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.3%20OneDotThree)

1.4. [Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string with %20.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.4%20OneDotFour)

1.5. [Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example: the string aabccccaa would become a2b1c4a2. If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, then return original string.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.5%20OneDotFive)

1.6. [Given an image represented by an NXN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.6%20OneDotSix) __Not Done__


1.7. [Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MXN matrix is zero, its entire row and column is set to 0.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.7%20OneDotSeven)


1.8. [Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s1 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat")](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/1.8%20OneDotEight)

####LinkedList
2.1. [Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/2.1%20TwoDotOne)


2.2. [Implement an algorithm to find the kth to the last element of a singly linked list.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/2.2%20TwoDotTwo)


2.3. [Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/2.3%20TwoDotThree)


2.4. [Write a code to partition a linkedlist around a value of x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater or equal to x.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/2.4%20TwoDotFour)


2.5. [You have two numbers representated by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digit are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two number and returns the sum as a linked list.](https://github.com/prashishh/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview/tree/master/2.5%20TwoDotFive)
