You have two numbers representated by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digit are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two number and returns the sum as a linked list.

(7->1->6) + (5->9->2) = 912
(9->1->2)
